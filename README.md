# Student Grade Calculator

## Description
This Python program allows users to enter student scores and categorizes each score as "Pass" or "Fail." A score of 60 or above is considered a "Pass," while anything below is a "Fail."

## How It Works
1. The program prompts the user to input scores for a set number of students.
2. It checks each score:
   - If the score is 60 or higher, it prints "Pass."
   - If the score is below 60, it prints "Fail."
